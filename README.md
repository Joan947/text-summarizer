# About [Anvil](https://anvil.works/?utm_source=github:app_README) App

### Doc Decoder App

This is an app that summarizes text and can generate answers to questions relating to the text. It uses NLP models to achieve this purpose. Specifically it uses the roBERTa Q&A model and facebook's BART large CNN model. This is an initial draft and the models have to be fine-tuned to improve their performance. Be expecting future updates.
